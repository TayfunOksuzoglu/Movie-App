# Movie-App
A Javascript/CSS/HTML Movie App Project.
This website is a simple movie search application that allows users to search for movies using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. Users can enter the name of a movie in the search box, and the website will fetch and display a list of relevant movies along with their basic details such as title, year, and poster image. Clicking on a movie from the search list reveals detailed information about the selected movie, including its poster, title, release year, ratings, genre, plot, and other relevant information.
